Blackjack Game(Done):
A player draws 2 cards,a dealer draws the same amount of cards,but 1 is hidden from the player.The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over 22.
If the player gets a sum of 21 on the first draw and the dealer doesnt also draw one,the player gets 150% of their original bet.If both the player get a 21 on the first round,
the player loses.On the second hand,the player has some options available:
-Hitting(to draw a card;if the player's sum after hitting is more than 22,he loses,otherwise he can Hit again or Stand)
-Standing(skipping the turn)
-Splitting(when the player has 2 of the same card in the first round,they can split their hand,doubling their chances of losing/winning(
-Doubledown(2x your bet on the first round,draw a card,but then you cant draw anymore)
The dealer has an algorithm that allows him to play.If the dealer's sum is less than 17,he draws a card untill he hits 17,otherwise he stand)
If the player/dealer didnt bust or win by Blackjack,at the end of the game their sum's are compared,and the one with the most points close to 21 wins.
